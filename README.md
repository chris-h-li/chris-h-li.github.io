## Repository Overview

This repository contains the files used to build out my portfolio website located at chris-h-li.github.io.

In the project_code folder, one can find the Python and R code files used for the analyses presented on my portfolio website.

For my Big Data Cup hockey analytics project, the code files should be run in this sequence:
1) clean_playbyplay_data.py
2) train_rnn_model_and_predict.py
3) zone_entry_exit_charts.py
The data used for this analysis can be accessed here: https://github.com/bigdatacup/Big-Data-Cup-2024
