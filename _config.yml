  I'm an MS in Statistics student at UC Davis and will graduate in December 2023. I am in interested applying statistical methods
  and machine learning models to answer interesting research questions in healthcare, biology, and professional sports. This website contains
  projects from my Master's degree coursework as well as personal projects I have done for fun.
  <br><br>
  This past summer 2023, I worked as a statistics intern at Takeda Pharamceuticals, where I developed R and SAS programs to perform numerical optimization
  and Monte Carlo simulations to evalute the benefit-risk profile of a treatment. Prior to my MS degree, I worked for three years at Cornerstone Research
  where I analyzed financial and healthcare datasets and performed statistical analyses such as regressions, conjoint analyses, and Monte Carlo simulations.
  Unfortunately, I am unable to showcase my work from these experiences due to the confidentiality of the data I was working with.
