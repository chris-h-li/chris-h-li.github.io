  I'm an MS in Statistics student at UC Davis and will graduate in December 2023. I am in interested applying statistical methods
  and machine learning models to answer interesting research questions in healthcare, biology, and professional sports. This website contains
  projects from my Master's degree coursework as well as personal projects I have done for fun.
  I am unable to showcase projects from my 3+ years of work experience at Cornerstone Research and Takeda Pharmaceuticals
  due to the confidentiality of the data I was working with.
