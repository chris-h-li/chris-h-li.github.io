  I graduated with an MS in Statistics from UC Davis in December 2023 and am currently working on the Data Science and Innovation team at Evolent. I enjoy applying statistical and machine learning models 
  to answer interesting questions in healthcare and sports, and I am passionate about hockey analytics. In addition, I have a specific interest in working with sequential models 
  and Bayesian hierarchial models, so in my free time I have been using these methods to develop innovative ways of evaluating professional hockey players (see links to the right). 
  Recently I submitted one of my hockey analytics projects to the 2024 Big Data Cup hosted by Stathletes, and my submission was selected 
  as a finalist (still awaiting final results). This website also contains sports and healthcare-related projects I have done as part of my MS degree.  I have completed many statistical analyses (Regressions,
  Monte Carlo Simulations, conjoint analyses, etc.) during my 3+ years of work experience at Cornerstone Research and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which are not presented here for confidentiality reasons.
