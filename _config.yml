  I'm an MS in Statistics student at UC Davis and will graduate in December 2023. I am interested applying statistical and machine learning models 
  to answer interesting questions in healthcare, biology, and professional sports. This website contains projects I have done as part of my MS degree
  and in my free time. I have completed several other projects from my 3+ years of work experience at Cornerstone Research and Takeda Pharmaceuticals,
  which are not presented here for confidentiality reasons.
